# toy-robot-planner-executor-architecture

A simple Python simulation project demonstrating the **Planner-Executor Architecture** without involving AI components. This project is designed as a learning tool to understand how planning and execution modules can interact to control an autonomous agentâ€”in this case, a robot moving on a 2D grid.

The robot can:
- Understand its orientation (North, East, South, West)
- Accept user-defined 2D coordinates
- Use actions (`MOVE_FORWARD`, `TURN_LEFT`, `TURN_RIGHT`) to reach the target position

The **Planner** generates a plan (a series of actions), and the **Executor** carries it out. These two components interface continuously, allowing the planner to update in real-time based on the outcome of execution.
